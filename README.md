# Assessment Review - All In One Python

- Modify `all_in_one.py` to solve the problem as stated in [TODO ref to content's problem description].
- The skeleton code needs to be fixed before the tests run.
- You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests shown below.
- DO NOT MODIFY TESTS IN THIS FILE `all_in_one.py`.

## To Test

- To run all the unittests on your terminal: `python3 -m unittest tests/all_in_one.py`
- To run a specific step's unittest on your terminal, e.g step 1: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_all_in_one.TestFunctions.test_get_date_of_birth`
- Note: at the minimum, these (unedited) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
